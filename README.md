#Units of Measurement (Legacy)

The Unit of Measurement library provides a set of Java language programming interfaces for handling units and quantities. The interfaces provide a layer which separates client code, that would call the API, from library code, which implements the API. Various groups have implemented the API, see the list of known implementations for details.

##The Project
The project was hosted on Google Code. And preserved on GitHub now anticipating Google Code shutdown.
